Thanks for buying!With the package, you have access to the Blend files; each one has a single fully rigged model so that you can create your own animations and modify the model as you wish. In order to change the colors to the pre-made palettes, just change thematerials "Suit-A.001", "Suit-A.002", and "Lens-A" to their corresponding ones ("Suit-B.001", "Suit-B.002", "Lens-B", etc.).You can change the model in any way you please.In order to get the models into Unity, simply drag and drop the Blend file.In the Unity package file, you will find 4 different models, each of a different color and with its respective 13 animations:	- Idle	- Walk	- Jogging	- Run	- Jump Start	- Jump Loop	- Jump Land	- Attack 1 (Right Hand)	- Attack 2 (Left Hand)	- Attack 3 (Kick)	- Get Hit	- Defeat	- Defeat LoopContact me for support:	E-mail: gliptoart@gmail.com	Instagram: @gliptoartCredits:Models and animations by GliptoRigging based on that by Royal Skies (https://www.theroyalskies.com/royal-resources)
